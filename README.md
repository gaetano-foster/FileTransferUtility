# File Transfer Utility

**File Transfer Utility (FTU)** is a Windows tool for batch file operations (**copy**, **move**, **delete**) based on filenames or wildcard patterns. It recursively searches folders and optionally preserves directory structure.

## Features

* Recursive search up to 5 levels
* Wildcard pattern matching (e.g., `*.jpg`, `data_*.csv`)
* Optional folder structure preservation
* Copy, move, or delete actions
* Error logging to `FileUtilsLogs.txt`

## Usage

* Select the **From Directory** (search root)
* Select the **To Directory** (target output)
